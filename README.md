## Testing Tasks

This project is designed to test various agent capabilities:

1. **Code Analysis**: The agent should be able to understand the React structure
2. **Feature Addition**: Adding new components or modifying existing ones
3. **Bug Fixes**: Fixing intentional issues in the code
4. **Testing**: Adding or modifying tests
5. **Build Process**: Running builds and handling any issues

## Known Issues

- No tests are currently implemented (intentional for testing)
- Basic styling could be improved
- No error boundaries implemented
